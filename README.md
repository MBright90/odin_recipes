A basic html website to link to different recipes

In creating this project I will be using and developing using links within a website. I will also be practicing using some basic html elements including headings. 

In addition, it will allow me to practice writing git commit messages and following the rules listed at https://cbea.ms/git-commit/ to ensure concise and helpful messages.
