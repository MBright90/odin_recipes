        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>With the right cooking method, even the toughest cut of meat can turn into a delicious barbecue. Brisket is a perfect example. 
            Brisket is taken from the breast section of a cow, just beneath the first five beef ribs and behind the foreshank. It is also 
            the same part that is used in making pastrami, corned beef or pot roast. Brisket can be a large cut of meat weighing between 
            3 and 8 pounds. Since this part is quite long, it is typically cut in half and sold as two pieces of meat in the supermarket.
            Looking at the meat, you'll notice a significant amount of connective tissue, and this is what's making the brisket tough. </p>

        <p>As brisket is a tough cut, the best method of preparing it involves slow cooking at lower temperatures for several hours. One 
            good example would be smoking, such as the famous Texas-style beef brisket which produces delicious and tender meat after you 
            smoke it for 8 to 12 hours in a wood fire. Other methods include braising or brining. Generally, brisket has a strong beefy 
            taste to it, but the cooking process greatly impacts the taste. Smoking and brining infuse specific flavors to the raw meat 
            while braising imparts the taste of the liquid. Of course, a delicious barbecue sauce can greatly enhance the taste.</p>

        <p>As brisket is divided into two different cuts, each half is given different names. The first cut, also known as the thin cut or 
            flat cut, is the leaner piece of the two cuts. The second, also known as the point cut or deckle, has a bit of extra fat so it 
            is more flavorful. The first cut is lean meat, and it slices up neatly and it is the preferred choice for corned beef. But for 
            bbq, the second cut is chosen as it renders the meat tender and juicy after long hours of cooking. The second cut of beef brisket 
            is also ideal for stewing and braising.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>1kg slow cook beef joint</li>
                <li>2 tbsp olive oil</li>
                <li>1 medium onion, chopped</li>
                <li>200ml bbq sauce</li>
                <li>4 tbsp soft brown sugar</li>
                <li>2 tbsp white wine vinegar</li>

                <li>1 tbsp smoked paprika</li>
            </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Turn the slow cooker on. Cut the joint into two pieces. Heat a large frying pan with 1 tbsp of the oil. 
                    Season the meat and sear on all sides. Place in the cooker.</li>
                <li>Using the same frying pan heat the remaining oil. Add the onion, season and saut√© for 5 minutes. Add 
                    the remaining ingredients and 200ml water and mix together.</li>
                <li>Pour over the meat and cook for 4 hours on high or 8 hours on low. Do not remove the lid during cooking 
                    or it will take longer.</li>
                <li>Remove the meat from the cooker. Shred the meat with two forks. Pour any excess off from the sauce and 
                    mix with the meat.  </li>
                <li>Serve the meat on toasted buns with rocket, tomato, peppadews or sliced pickles and red onion slices.</li>
