        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Pork crackling is a lighter pork snack made by twice frying pig's skin taken from either the shoulder or the shank. The second cook is more of 
            a flash fry and causes the scratching to inflate, adding more air to the product, making the consequent crackling lighter and crunchier than 
            pork scratchings. The second fry naturally reduces some of the pork's flavour, and so is a great opportunity to add exciting seasonings. At 
            Snaffling Pig HQ (or Pork Knox as its known), they add maple, chilli, black pepper and loads more great flavours at this stage.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>

                <li>2-3 tsp sea salt or table salt</li>
            </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat oven to 220C or 200C fan-forced.</li>
                <li>Place crackling rind-side up onto a rack over a shallow baking dish. Brush well with oil. Sprinkle generously with salt.</li>
