        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>In order to answer the question “What is paella?”, you first have to understand its history. This story starts with Spanish rice farmers 
            who lived near Lake Albufera in Valencia in the 15th century. They cooked, typically over vines or orange branches, what they could rummage 
            from the rice fields for their lunch. These ingredients included plump tomatoes, sweet onions, beans, occasionally snails, and — of course 
            — rice.</p>

        <p>Since the Arabic Moors bought rice to the Iberian Peninsula in the 800s, Valencia has been one of the most significant rice-producing regions 
            in Spain. Valencian rice, as it was coined, consists of three medium short-grain, “rice pearl” varieties: Bahia, Bomba, and Senia — the second 
            is the most common pick for paella. It uniquely doubles or triples volume without opening or sticking during cooking, thus absorbing intense 
            flavor (and deliciousness).</p>
            
        <p>It's important to harp on about this rice because paella is, above all, a rice dish. Most agree that the essential ingredients for paella are 
            rice, some form of protein (chicken, seafood, rabbit), legumes and/or vegetables, olive oil, and saffron (also brought to the Iberian Peninsula 
            by the Moors). You might hear people today arguing that seafood has no place in a traditional paella, but the fact is that seafood paella was 
            born because it served the same purpose as the original: People needed a simple and affordable dish to prepare with local (in this case, coastal) 
            ingredients.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 tbsp olive oil</li>
            <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
            <li>1 tsp each hot smoked paprika and dried thyme</li>
            <li>300g paella or risotto rice</li>
            <li>3 tbsp dry sherry or white wine (optional)</li>
            <li>400g can chopped tomatoes with garlic</li>
            <li>900ml chicken stock</li>
            <li>400g frozen seafood mix , defrosted</li>
            <li>1 lemon, ½ juiced, ½ cut into wedges</li>
            <li>handful of flat-leaf parsley, roughly chopped</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat the olive oil in a large frying pan or wok. Add the onion and soften for 5 mins.</li>
            <li>Add the smoked paprika, thyme and paella rice, stir for 1 min, then splash in the sherry, if using. Once evaporated, stir in the chopped tomatoes and chicken stock.</li>
            <li>Season and cook, uncovered, for about 15 mins, stirring now and again until the rice is almost tender and still surrounded with some liquid.</li>
            <li>Stir in the seafood mix and cover with a lid. Simmer for 5 mins, or until the seafood is cooked through and the rice is tender. Squeeze over the lemon juice, scatter over the parsley and serve with the lemon wedges.</li>
        </ol>
